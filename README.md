# CalFood
It will identify the food and gives you the calorie of the food item in KCal/100g


## Usage

To get started, create an account at [developer.clarifai.com](http://developer.clarifai.com).

Create an application, and get your API Key.

This basic starter uses your API Key to make prediction calls. This will never expire so you only have to fill it in once.

You'll notice that in the `.gitignore` file, it references a `keys.js` file. This is for security purposes, so you don't share your API Key with others.  Add the following to that file:

```
var myApiKey = 'YOUR API KEY HERE';
```
